Fearing the worst, the case was elevated by LAPD commanders from the missing persons squad to the Homicide Division, where Harry Bosch was assigned the case. But the 22-year-old woman never turned up — dead or alive — and it was a case Bosch couldn’t crack.\n\n                    Thirteen years later Bosch is in the Open-Unsolved Unit when he gets a call from the DA’s office. A man accused of two heinous killings is willing to come clean in regard to several other murders in a deal to avoid the death penalty. One of those murders, he says, is the killing of Marie Gesto. Bosch is now assigned to take Raynard Waits’ confession and to make sure the killer is not scamming authorities to avoid a date with death."},{"id":1,"name":"Rich Dad Poor Dad","about":"Robert Kiosaki","status":"not available","imagePath":"/images/rich_dad_poor_dad.jpg","description":"Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter.
